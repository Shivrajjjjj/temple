Dedicated to Lord Vishnu, Badrinath Temple is positioned along the banks of the Alakananda River and is one of the four Char Dhams. 
Captivating worshippers from far and wide,the temple is perched at an elevation of approximately 10,827 above sea level.
Enhancing the sanctity of the temple is the idol of Lord Vishnu in a meditative and composed posture around which there are 15 idols carved out of black stone. 
Considered among the major pilgrim sites in India,the temple remains open only from May to November owing to extreme weather conditions.
Badrinath or Badrinarayana Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Vishnu which is situated in the town of Badrinath in Uttarakhand, India.
The temple is also one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Badrinath—holy shrines for Vaishnavites.
It is open for six months every year (between the end of April and the beginning of November), because of extreme weather conditions in the Himalayan region.
The temple is located in Garhwal hill tracks in Chamoli district along the banks of Alaknanda River.
It is one of the most visited pilgrimage centers of India, having recorded 1,060,000 visits.
The image of the presiding deity worshipped in the temple is a 1 ft (0.30 m), the black granite deity of Vishnu in the form of Badrinarayan.
The deity is considered by many Hindus to be one of eight swayam vyakta kshetras, or self-manifested deities of Vishnu.

Mata Murti Ka Mela, which commemorates the descent of river Ganges on mother earth, is the most prominent festival celebrated in the Badrinath Temple.
Although Badrinath is located in North India, the head priest, or Rawal, is traditionally a Nambudiri Brahmin chosen from the South Indian state of Kerala.
The temple was included in the Uttar Pradesh state government Act No. 30/1948 as Act no. 16,1939, which later came to be known as Shri Badarinath and Shri Kedarnath Mandir Act.
The committee nominated by the state government administers both the temples and has seventeen members on its board.The temple is mentioned in ancient religious texts like Vishnu Purana and Skanda Purana.
It is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, an early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th–9th centuries AD.The temple is located in Garhwal hill tracts along the banks of the Alaknanda River in Chamoli district in Uttarakhand.
The hill tracts are located 3,133 m (10,279 ft) above the mean sea level.
The Nar Parbat mountain is located opposite to the temple, while the Narayana Parbat is located behind the Neelkanth peak.
The temple has three structures: the Garbhagriha (sanctum), the Darshan Mandap (worship hall), and Sabha Mandap (convention hall).
The conical-shaped roof of the sanctum, the garbhagriha,
is approximately 15 m (49 ft) tall with a small cupola on top, covered with a gold gilt roof.The facade is built of stone and has arched windows. A broad stairway leads up to the main entrance,
a tall, arched gateway. Just inside is a mandap, a large, pillared hall that leads to the sanctum, or main shrine area.

The walls and pillars of the hall are covered with intricate carvings.
The main shrine houses the 1 ft (0.30 m) Shaligram (black stone) deity of Lord Badrinarayana, which is housed in a gold canopy under a Badri Tree.
The deity of Lord Badrinarayana shows Him holding a Shankha (conch) and a Chakra (wheel) in two of His arms in a lifted posture and the other two arms resting on His lap in a Yogamudra (Padmasana) posture.
The sanctum also houses images of the god of wealth—Kubera, sage Narada, Uddhava, Nar and Narayan. There are fifteen more images that are also worshipped around the temple. These include that of Lakshmi (the consort of Vishnu),
Garuda (the vahana of Narayan), and Navadurga, the manifestation of Durga in nine different forms. The temple also has shrines of Lakshmi Narasimhar and for saints Adi Shankara (AD 788-820), Nar and Narayan,
Ghantakarna, Vedanta Desika and Ramanujacharya. All the deities of the temple are made of black stone.
The Tapt Kund, a group of hot sulphur springs just below the temple, are considered to be medicinal; many pilgrims consider it a requirement to bathe in the springs before visiting the temple.
The springs have a year-round temperature of 55 °C (131 °F), while outside temperature is typically below 17 °C (63 °F) all year round.
The two water ponds in the temple are called Narad Kund and Surya Kund.
There is no historical record about the temple, but there is a mention of the presiding deity Badrinath in Vedic scriptures (c. 1750–500 BC).
According to some accounts, the temple was a Buddhist shrine till the 8th century and Adi Shankara converted it to a Hindu temple.The architecture of the temple resembling that of a Buddhist vihara (temple) and the brightly painted facade which is atypical of Buddhist temples leads to the argument.

Other accounts relate that it was originally established as a pilgrimage site by Adi Shankara in the ninth century.
It is believed that Shankara resided in place for six years from AD 814 to 820.He resided six months in Badrinath and the rest of the year in Kedarnath.
Hindu followers assert that he discovered the deity of Badrinath in the Alaknanda River and enshrined it in a cave near the Tapt Kund hot springs.
A traditional story asserts that Shankara expelled all the Buddhists in the region with the help of the Parmar ruler king Kanak Pal. The hereditary successors of the king governed the temple and endowed villages to meet its expenses.
The income from a set of villages on the route to the temple was used to feed and accommodate pilgrims. The Parmar rulers held the title "Bolanda Badrinath", meaning speaking Badrinath.They had other titles,
including Shri 108 Basdrishcharyaparayan Garharaj Mahimahendra, Dharmabibhab, and Dharamarakshak Sigamani.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The throne of Badrinath was named after the presiding deity; the king enjoyed ritual obeisance by the devotees before proceeding to the shrine.
The practice was continued until the late 19th century.During the 16th century, the King of Garhwal moved the murti to the present temple.
When the state of Garhwal was divided, the Badrinath temple came under British rule but the king of Garhwal continued as the chairman of the management committee.
The selection of priest is done after consultation between Garhwal and Travancore royal families.
The temple has undergone several major renovations due to its age and damage by an avalanche. In the 17th century, the temple was expanded by the Kings of Garhwal.
After significant damage during the great 1803 Garhwal earthquake, it was largely rebuilt by the King of Jaipur.It was still under renovation as late as the 1870s 
but these were completed by the time of the First World War.At that time, the town was still small, consisting of only the 20-odd huts housing the temple's staff,
but the number of pilgrims was usually between seven and ten thousand.The Kumbh Mela festival held every twelve years raised the number of visitors to 50,000.
The temple also enjoyed revenue from the rents owed to it by various villages bequeathed by various rajas.
During 2006, the state government announced the area around Badrinath as a no construction zone to curb illegal encroachment.
