A Hindu temple, often <span style="font-style:italic;">Mandir(मंदिर)</span> in India, is a symbolic house, seat and body of divinity for Hindus.It is a structure designed to bring human beings and gods together, using symbolism to express the ideas and beliefs of Hinduism.
The symbolism and structure of a Hindu temple are rooted in Vedic traditions, deploying circles and squares.It also represents recursion and the representation of the equivalence of the macrocosm and the microcosm by astronomical numbers, 
and by "specific alignments related to the geography of the place and the presumed linkages of the deity and the patron".A temple incorporates all elements of the Hindu cosmos — presenting the good, the evil and the human, as well as the elements of the 
Hindu sense of cyclic time and the essence of life — symbolically presenting dharma, kama, artha, moksa, and karma.The spiritual principles symbolically represented in Hindu temples are given in the ancient Sanskrit texts of India (for example, the Vedas and Upanishads),
 while their structural rules are described in various ancient Sanskrit treatises on architecture (Bṛhat Saṃhitā, Vāstu Śāstras).The layout, the motifs, the plan and the building process recite ancient rituals, geometric symbolisms, and reflect beliefs and values innate within various schools of Hinduism.
A Hindu temple is a spiritual destination for many Hindus, as well as landmarks around which ancient arts, community celebrations and economy have flourished.

Hindu temples come in many styles, are situated in diverse locations, deploy different construction methods and are adapted to different deities and regional beliefs,yet almost all of them share certain core ideas, symbolism and themes.
They are found in South Asia, particularly India and Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, in Southeast Asian countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Island of Indonesia,and countries such as Canada, Fiji, France, Guyana, Kenya,
Mauritius, the Netherlands, South Africa, Suriname, Tanzania, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries with a significant Hindu population.
The current state and outer appearance of Hindu temples reflect arts, materials and designs as they evolved over two millennia; they also reflect the effect of conflicts between Hinduism and Islam since the 12th century.
The Swaminarayanan Akshardham in Robbinsville, New Jersey, United States, between the New York and Philadelphia metropolitan areas, was inaugurated in 2014 as one of the world's largest Hindu temples.
A Hindu temple reflects a synthesis of arts, the ideals of dharma, beliefs, values and the way of life cherished under Hinduism. It is a link between man, deities, and the Universal Puruṣa in a sacred space.
It represents the triple-knowledge (trayi-vidya) of the Vedic vision by mapping the relationships between the cosmos (brahmaṇḍa) and the cell (pinda) by a unique plan based on astronomical numbers.
Subhash Kak sees the temple form and its iconography to be a natural expansion of Vedic ideology related to recursion, change and equivalence.

In ancient Indian texts, a temple is a place of pilgrimage, known in India as a Tirtha.It is a sacred site whose ambience and design attempts to symbolically condense the ideal tenets of the Hindu way of life.
All the cosmic elements that create and sustain life are present in a Hindu temple – from fire to water, from images of nature to deities, from the feminine to the masculine, from the fleeting sounds and incense 
smells to the eternality and universality at the core of the temple.Susan Lewandowski states that the underlying principle in a Hindu temple is the belief that all things are one, that everything is connected.
The pilgrim is welcomed through 64-grid or 81-grid mathematically structured spaces, a network of art, pillars with carvings and statues that display and celebrate the four important and necessary principles of human life – 
the pursuit of artha (prosperity, wealth), of kama (pleasure, sex), of dharma (virtues, ethical life) and of moksha (release, self-knowledge).At the centre of the temple, typically below and sometimes above or next to the deity,
is mere hollow space with no decoration, symbolically representing Purusa, the Supreme Principle, the sacred Universal, one without form, which is present everywhere, connects everything, and is the essence of everyone.
A Hindu temple is meant to encourage reflection, facilitate purification of one's mind, and trigger the process of inner realization within the devotee.The specific process is left to the devotee's school of belief.
The primary deity of different Hindu temples varies to reflect this spiritual spectrum.

In Hindu tradition, there is no dividing line between the secular and the lonely sacred.In the same spirit, Hindu temples are not just sacred spaces; they are also secular spaces.
Their meaning and purpose have extended beyond spiritual life to social rituals and daily life, offering thus a social meaning. Some temples have served as a venue to mark festivals,
to celebrate arts through dance and music, to get married or commemorate marriages,the birth of a child, other significant life events or the death of a loved one.
In political and economic life,Hindu temples have served as a venue for succession within dynasties and landmarks around which economic activity thrived.India being part of the world’s oldest civilizations is a land of rich history, countless beliefs, traditions and legends surrounding the religions. India takes pride in the country’s rich cultural and religious history as it is the birth land of the traditions of Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. India is a land where people of different religious beliefs live in harmony and brotherhood. Hinduism is believed to be the world’s oldest religion. Unlike other religions, Hinduism does not have a founder but is instead a fusion of religions. Various ancient manuscripts and scholars describe the religion as a traditional way of living, a religion whose beginning and ending cannot be traced.
The heavenly abode of the Almighty on Earth is referred to as ‘Mandir’ by the Hindus. You will find majestic temples at mostly every corner of the country. Every temple has a unique history and legend attached to it. During the ancient times, the Indian rulers would patronize artists and sculptures for creating exceptional masterpieces in the form of temples under their reign. Tour My India introduces you to some of the most popular and magnificent temples of the country.
